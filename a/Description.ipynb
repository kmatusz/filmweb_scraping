    "Filmweb is a website on which users can obtain information about movies. It also provides convenient way to rate movies. The users are able to give ratings from 1 to 10 stars. The website also provides social networking functions. Users can add friends and compare their ratings. One of the convenient features is the ability to log in with facebook, and obtain friends suggestions from there. "
